# TODO
* end plates
  * something to mount soft feet to?
    * because damn the printer is noisy with no damping and very quiet with it
* wire hotend
  * replace fan wiring with longer wires
* wire heated build plate
* Y carriage
  * print or cut out of aluminum
  * include strain relief for wiring
* heat spreader/build surface
  * cut out of aluminum
* attach the bottom/electronics cover to endplates and/or extrusion somehow
* insulate under HBP
* auto BOM-building via parsing comments from openscad
  * look into what nophead did for the mendel90
