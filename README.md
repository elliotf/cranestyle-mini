# My take on the "Cranestyle mini"

# TODO
* end plates
  * more room to be able to plug usb cable in
  * strain relief
    * anchor for extruder wires
    * anchor for heated build plate wires
  * something for the MGN carriage to hit before the idler?
    * or make it tslot mounted?
    * if it's on the endplate, it can help align the MGN rail
  * move power connector to opposite side
    * to get away from endstops and steppers to avoid crosstalk
* duet mounting
  * make "bevel" flat so that duet sits at a known height
    * so that the heatspreader will not be wonky
* electronics/configuration
  * get motors running (need to be able to plug USB in)
  * test sensorless endstops
* wire hotend
* wire heated build plate
* Y carriage
  * print or cut out of aluminum
  * include strain relief for wiring
* heat spreader/build surface
  * cut out of aluminum
* attach the bottom/electronics cover to endplates and/or extrusion somehow
* anchor X carriage bundle somehow for strain relief
  * to Z motor mount?
  * to Y extrusion?
* extruder motor
  * sleeve (and braid?) wires
  * connector
* X motor wires
  * sleeve (and braid?) wires
* insulate under HBP
* auto BOM-building via parsing comments from openscad
  * look into what nophead did for the mendel90
