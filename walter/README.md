# A subset of walter's mini cranestyle design files

Walter is awesome, and is the person that pointed me to this 3d printer design.

I am using some of his parts, as some of these are pretty complex (X carriage) and I don't know if I'll be able to reproduce his work in openscad, and want to get printing with this printer soon.
